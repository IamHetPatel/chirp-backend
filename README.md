# Chirp - The Social Media App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of Chirp, a social media app where users can connect, share posts, and engage with each other. This backend portion is responsible for handling user authentication, managing posts, and providing necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Chirp's backend is built using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime known for its scalability and performance.
  
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB serves as the database management system for Chirp, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing user data and posts.
  
- **Express.js**: Express.js is used as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of building robust and efficient APIs.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Chirp implements user authentication to ensure secure access to the platform. Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate their identity.
   
2. **Post Routes**: The backend provides routes to handle CRUD operations for posts. Users can create, read, update, and delete posts through these routes.

3. **User Routes**: User-related routes are available to manage user profiles and information. This includes fetching user details, updating profiles, and other user-related operations.

## Models

- **Post Model**: Defines the structure of a post, including fields such as content, author, timestamp, etc.
  
- **User Model**: Describes the properties and behaviors of a user, including fields like username, email, password hash, etc.
